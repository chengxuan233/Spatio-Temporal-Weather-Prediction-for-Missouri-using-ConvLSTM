This project aims to improve short-term weather forecasting accuracy using a spatiotemporal deep learning approach, specifically ConvLSTM. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, while effective, often struggle with extreme weather conditions and require significant computational resources.
By leveraging high-resolution historical climate datasets (NClimGrid-Daily) and NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2), we will develop a deep-learning model capable of capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies in weather patterns.

The dataset was retrived from National Centers for Environmental Information(NCEI) https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/nclimgrid-daily, and The NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GLDAS_CLSM025_DA1_D_2.2/summary?keywords=GLDAS.
